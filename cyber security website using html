 <b>  How can be secure our data or information ? </b>
</h3>
<p>
 1. Making regular backups of files (backup copies should be stored in fireproof safes or in another building).<br>

 2. Protecting yourself against viruses by running anti-virus software.<br>

 3. Using a system of passwords so that access to data is restricted.<br>

 4. Safe storage of important files stored on removable disks, eg locked away in a fireproof and waterproof safe.<br>

 5. Allowing only authorised staff into certain computer areas, eg by controlling entry to these areas by means of ID cards or magnetic swipe cards.<br>

 6. Always logging off or turning terminals off and if possible locking them.<br>

 7. Avoiding accidental deletion of files by write-protecting disks.<br>

 8. Using data encryption techniques to code data so that it makes no apparent sense.<br>
